     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
 
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     highest occupied level (ev):    -3.5742

!    total energy              =    -541.53390192 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <      22.46804505 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =   -2304.09608375 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    1175.39632829 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -163.15364765 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     750.31950118 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in 100 iterations
